Use let constants as often as possible --> faster code and many things don't need to be changed:
  - like the file manager reference, core bundle paths etc...

try! --> try the following code, which could go wrong, but I'm certain it will work and if it doesn't work then nothing else will anyway

Give controllers in the story board a StoryBoardID --> can then tell the app to load this controller/view by using
instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "storyboardID") from anywhere in the code --> will have to use optionals for this
because swift doesn't know its coming from the story board --> will need to typecast and then tell navigation controller to enact the change

// inside a different controller
override func tableView(_ tableView: UITableView, didSelectRowAt indexPath: IndexPath) {
    if let vc = storyboard?.instantiateViewController(withIdentifier: "Detail") as? DetailViewController {
        vc.selectedImage = pictures[indexPath.row] // set the properties of the other controller.
        navigationController?.pushViewController(vc, animated: true)
    }
}

ctrl + click and drag from a ui element to add constraints
Asset Catalogs -- optimized form of image/content management for apps
Select Frames and then alt+cmd+= to update the frames to conform with autolayout - (or editor -> autoresolve layout issues -> update frames)
Have to add outlets to be able to reference things (like buttons, image views, etc...) in code

CALayer is one of the main ways to adjust the appearance of the app (core animation layer)

GamePlayKit (built into everything)

Connections:
  - @IBOutlet is a way of connecting code to storyboard layouts
  - @IBAction is a way of making storyboard layouts trigger code

  UIAlertController().
    - This is used to show an alert with options to the user.
    - there are two kinds of style: \
        - .alert, which pops up a message box over the center of the screen,
          - use this when informing user of a situation change
        - .actionSheet, which slides options up from the bottom.


  This error message:
  “Cannot convert value of type ‘() -> ()’ to expected argument type ‘((UIAlertAction) -> Void)?"
  - basically says I want the function you told me to run to take type UIAlertAction as an input

  Remember to do the "embed in navigation controller"
